			GrayFace MM7 Patch v2.5.7<br>By Sergey Rozhenko &lt;mailto:sergroj@mail.ru&gt;<br>https://grayface.github.io/<br><br>Official patches, Mok's patch and Black Phantom's patch are included.<br>Save files are, of course, fully compatible with the unpatched game in both directions.<br>The patch has no uninstaller to make things simpler.<br>All configuration is done via mm7.ini, which is populated with main options on the first run.<br>For all exploits the patch fixes an option to disable the fix shoud be described in this ReadMe.<br>At the end of ReadMe you'll find info on how to report errors.<br><br>([+] &ndash; feature, [-] &ndash; fixed bug, [*] &ndash; other)<br><br>New in version 2.5.7:<br>  &lt;&lt; MM6 &ndash; MM8 &gt;&gt;<br>[*] Support (i.e. no problems like crashes) for old saves with inconsequential incorrect data caused by my bug fixed in the previous version.<br>  &lt;&lt; MM7, MM8 &gt;&gt;<br>[-] My bug: The Acid Burst fix that changes its element from Physical to Water was doing so even if it's explicitly set Physical in spells.txt. Now you can also disable the Acid Burst fix by adding FixAcidBurst=0 to INI.<br><br>New in version 2.5.6:<br>  &lt;&lt; MM6 &ndash; MM8 &gt;&gt;<br>[+] New command available to map scripts (*.evt) that powers some of the MM6 and MM7 changes of this version (code 0x45 &ndash; RefundChestArtifacts).<br>[-] Items laying on the ground in one map were appearing in another when traveling by foot sometimes. Add FixItemDuplicates=0 to INI to disable this fix.<br>[-] My bug: DisableHooks option wasn't working for some new hooks.<br>[-] My bug: When custom *.games.lod archives are used, incorrect data was written to autosave on New Game start. It was fully inconsequential until version 2.5.4.<br>  &lt;&lt; MM7, MM8 &gt;&gt;<br>[-] My bug: The DirectX 7 bug/limitation fix was being applied prematurely, causing a crash on Wine.<br>  &lt;&lt; MM7 &gt;&gt;<br>[-] My bug caused by abnormal localization: In German version of the game the party was shooting torches with patch version 2.5.*. This fix also fixes abnormalities of some sprites in that localization.<br>  &lt;&lt; Fixes in maps &gt;&gt;<br>[-] The Maze (d02), The Titans' Stronghold (d09): It was possible for artifacts to be generated in inaccessible chests, reducing the number of artifacts you could find as a result.<br><br>New in version 2.5.5:<br>  &lt;&lt; MM6 &ndash; MM8 &gt;&gt;<br>[-] My bug: Possible character resistances corruption when taking an item from the inventory.<br>[-] My bug: FixChests option got broken by 2.5.4 changes.<br>  &lt;&lt; MM7, MM8 &gt;&gt;<br>[*] FixUnmarkedArtifacts option now also respects the 13 artifacts limit imposed by the game.<br><br>New in version 2.5.4:<br>  &lt;&lt; MM6 &ndash; MM8 &gt;&gt;<br>[-] Now, when a location re-spawns, all artifacts generated in chests you've never opened get cleared from "obtained artifacts" list.<br>  &lt;&lt; MM7, MM8 &gt;&gt;<br>[-] My bug: FixMonstersBlockingShots option didn't work right.<br>  &lt;&lt; MM7 &gt;&gt;<br>[*] I've disabled FixUnmarkedArtifacts by default, because Titan's Stronghold had an unreachable chest with an artifact, still present in Rev4 mod or games started before this version of patch.<br>[-] My bug: IndoorFovMul option was only working in UILayout mode.<br>  &lt;&lt; Fixes in maps &gt;&gt;<br>[-] The Titans' Stronghold (d09), Temple of the Dark (t02): Artifacts could be generated in inaccessible chests, reducing the number of artifacts the party can get.<br><br>New in version 2.5.2:<br>  &lt;&lt; MM6 &ndash; MM8 &gt;&gt;<br>[*] Now character's Stats screen displays a condition that determines stats, in all other places the most severe one is displayed.<br>  &lt;&lt; MM6, MM7 &gt;&gt;<br>[-] Now simple message dialog (e.g. obelisk message) isn't cancelled by pressing any key. In MM7 the message also doesn't stay on the screen after being cancelled anymore. Add DontSkipSimpleMessage=0 to INI to disable this fix.<br>  &lt;&lt; MM7, MM8 &gt;&gt;<br>[-] "Nothing here" was shown on the screen after a dialog with a guard.<br>[-] My bug: List of all conditions wasn't displayed in right click menu for Condition in Stats screen.<br><br>New in version 2.5.1:<br>  &lt;&lt; MM7, MM8 &gt;&gt;<br>[-] My bug: Energy damage wasn't displayed in identify monster dialog.<br><br>New in version 2.5:<br>  &lt;&lt; MM6 &ndash; MM8 &gt;&gt;<br>[+] Set ShooterMode=1 to enable FPS-like mode. Press attack button to toggle the fight mode, then press left mouse button to attack and right button to use quick spell. Regular quick spell button also works. No auto-targeting is done. A sword icon indicates this mode, which also shows health of target (or last hit) monster.<br>[+] Now you can set a spell that would be used when you press regular attack button. E.g. you can set Poison Spray as Attack Spell and Heal as Quick Spell. Add EnableAttackSpell=0 to INI to disable.<br>[+] ViewDistanceD3D option to set view distance in Hardware 3D mode, increased to 12000 by default. In Software mode you can increase view distance slightly by setting dist_mist. Known issue I haven't been able to fix yet: ViewDistanceD3D above game's default 8192 causes occasional brief disappearance of a near ground tile.<br>[+] Direct unaccelerated mouse input supported through MouseSensitivityDirectMul option. To enable, set it to a positive number, e.g. 1.0.<br>[+] Player condition priorities changed to demonstrate the worst condition (weak, cursed etc.). Add FixConditionPriorities=0 to INI to disable. New conditions order is Eradicated, Dead, Stoned, Unconscious, Paralyzed, Asleep, Weak, Cursed, Disease3, Poison3, Disease2, Poison2, Disease1, Poison1, Insane, Drunk, Afraid, Zombie.<br>[+] Now while you're holding right mouse button hint would be shown for the element you're pointing at. Especially useful for checking current time. Add ShowHintWithRMB=0 to INI to disable.<br>[+] In inventory screen unidentified items are now painted green while you're holding right mouse button. Add GreenItemsWhileRightClick=0 to INI to disable.<br>[+] Set DeadPlayerShowItemInfo=1 to be able to see items of unconscious players with right click.<br>[+] Better fix for inactive players acting: now you can select inactive players, but if you press the attack key, an active player would be selected.<br>[+] MouseLookPermKey option sets up the key that changes mouse look mode, but the mode doesn't get restored when a dialog is opened.<br>[+] Set ExitDialogsWithRightButton=1 to make right mouse button act as Esc in houses, NPC, map entrance and message dialogs.<br>[+] WinScreenDelay hidden option controls Win screen delay during which all input is ignored. Default is 500 (half a second instead of game's original 5 seconds).<br>[+] Set AddDescriptions=1 to add option descriptions straight into INI file. Set it to -1 to remove them.<br>[+] MonSpritesSizeMul option allows you to change the scale at which monsters are displayed in right button dialog. E.g. set it to 0.5 if you upscale monsters by 2. Mods can change it dynamically through the patch options API.<br>[+] House animation is no longer restarted when you click any topic. Add FixHouseAnimationRestart=0 to INI to disable this change.<br>[+] Free space check when saving a game. Add CheckFreeSpace=0 to INI to disable.<br>[+] Automatic horseman and boatman speak time detection. HorsemanSpeakTimeLimit and BoatmanSpeakTimeLimit hidden options are used as the maximum time allowed for the speeches.<br>[+] Wands no longer disappear when depleated, just break. Add KeepEmptyWands=0 in INI to disable this change.<br>[+] Fixed graphics of monsters that looked the same in all 3 variations.<br>[-] Changing item graphics was causing inventory corruption.<br>[-] Poison Spray, Shrapmetal and second spell attacks by monsters were doing wrong damage. Shrapmetal also wasn't going in an arc as it should. Add FixMonsterSpells=0 to INI to disable these fixes. (thanks cthscr)<br>[-] AOE damage wasn't dealt to paralyzed monsters.<br>[-] Element hints staying visible in some dialogs after moving the mouse off the element. Add HintStayTime=0 to INI to return this behavior. Default is 2, making hint stay up for 2 frames.<br>[-] Casting stronger buffs did nothing if a weaker, but longer one is active.<br>[-] Item spells were causing bugs when cast onto the very first item in the inventory.<br>[-] Now you when pick up items stolen from you from corpses of thieves it's properly indicated in status bar.<br>[-] Monster attacks were causing a player switch even if Endurance eliminates hit recovery.<br>[-] When casting a Quick Spell the spell points check was incorrect (it assigned GM spell to another school of magic)<br>[-] The game couldn't be run normally when current folder is different from its folder. Add KeepCurrentDirectory=1 to INI to disable this fix.<br>[-] Unconscious players could identify/repair items in shops before. Add FixDeadPlayerIdentifyItem=0 to INI to disable this fix.<br>[-] Another situation where game could crash due to vertex-less facets.<br>[-] New Day effects (weakness, insanity etc.) weren't triggered on beginning of a month when pressing "Wait until Dawn" and then Esc.<br>[-] Often there was full brightness outdoors for a minute at 5:00 AM.<br>[-] Random item generation routine was generating the first matching item with bigger probability and last matching item with smaller probability. (Thanks for Tomsod for this and many fixes that I've incorporated)<br>[-] Buff duration was displayed incorrectly in the cases like "1 day 5 minutes".<br>[-] Spell duration string for items and "N/A" string for ranged damage weren't localizeable.<br>[-] Water Walk was draining mana every 5 minutes instead of every 20 minutes. Add FixWaterWalkManaDrain=0 to INI to disable this fix.<br>[-] My bug: You were able to learn unavailable magic skills with keyboard navigation.<br>[*] Now spell skills that don't fit on the screen (say, if you change class in Rev4 mod for MM7) are now drawn over buttons. It's still better than making them inaccessible.<br>[*] 3DO and other logos are now shown when intro is postponed by NoIntro=1, unless NoIntoLogos=0 line is added to INI. You can cancel logos with Esc and still watch the intro.<br>  &lt;&lt; MM6, MM7 &gt;&gt;<br>[-] Horizontal speed of snow was effected by strafing too much.<br>[-] Copyright screen staying visible on startup if game window wasn't in focus when it appeared.<br>[-] Awards page wasn't updated when player is switched by pressing Tab.<br>[-] 'Charm' spell had wrong durations.<br>  &lt;&lt; MM7, MM8 &gt;&gt;<br>[+] UI.txt: New FloatingScreens mode makes inventory, houses and other such screens open in a panel.<br>[+] With IndoorFovMul hidden option you can specify the amount by which FOV is multiplied indoors in Hardware mode. Default is 0.813.<br>[+] TrueColorSprites hidden option, off by default to prevent 'out of memory' with HD sprites.<br>[+] The game now doesn't crash on exit if d3dsprite.hwl and d3dbitmap.hwl are missing.<br>[+] "Mapbkg" will be used as the background for minimap if present in *.icons.lod. This will help color blind people see blue dots on the minimap better.<br>[+] Now explosions and missiles are ignored during targeting in Hardware 3D mode too, unless ClickThroughEffects=0.<br>[+] When ddraw.dll is found in game folder (patch assumes it's dgVoodoo), you'll be asked whether you want to use it and SystemDDraw option would be set accordingly.<br>[+] Now you can climb steep mountains, like you used to when the game came out, unless ClimbBetter=0.<br>[-] If you set FixMonstersBlockingShots=1, enemy monsters won't block each other's shots with their body indoor resulting in projectiles being suspended in the air. This would fix the bug of reanimated monsters being unable to hit enemies of the same kind. This may increase difficulty of some encounters, like one in Rev4 mod.<br>[-] Fixed DirectX 7 bug: inability to support big resolutions in Hardware accelerated mode.<br>[-] Windows 10 compatibility issue fixed both in the game and Setup. Windowed mode also unlocked in Setup.<br>[-] Changing a static texture to an animated one by a script was causing a crash next time the location is loaded.<br>[-] Monsters shot at from a distance beyond active radius were appearing as green dots on minimap.<br>[-] In Display Inventory screen you couldn't do anything with unconscious players.<br>[-] Damage bonus of Assassins' and Barbarians' enchantments didn't work.<br>[-] Grand spell skill wasn't read from Monsters.txt when written as "GM".<br>[-] Ice Blast was read as Ice Bolt from Monsters.txt. Add FixIceBoltBlast=0 to INI to disable this fix.<br>[-] Energy damage type was being turned into Earth when read from Monsters.txt. Add FixEnergyDamageType=0 to INI to disable this fix.<br>[-] Gamma.pcx file was created whenever you open menu.<br>[-] Souldrinker was hitting monsters beyond party range. Add FixSouldrinker=0 to INI to disable this fix.<br>[-] Acid Burst spell was doing physical damage.<br>[-] Inability to equip sword or dagger when a spear is equipped and its skill is below Master.<br>[-] Arcomage hanging in some circumstances.<br>[-] Walking on water was dealing Fire damage.<br>[-] Bow skill bonus from items wasn't added to damage when you have Grandmaster Bow skill.<br>[-] When a monster attacked another one with a spell, wrong spell was used in damage calculation.<br>[-] Melee monsters under Berserk were hitting party from a far if their target died.<br>[-] Failed alchemy was breaking Hardened items.<br>[-] "of Acid" enchantment was dealing Water damage instead of Body.<br>[-] Armageddon spell was dealing unresistable damage. Now it deals Dark damage. Add ArmageddonElement=5 to INI to disable this fix.<br>[-] LeaveMap event wasn't called when travelling via stables or boat.<br>[-] Monsters summoning other monsters was causing a crash if monsters limit is already reached.<br>[-] "Body" attack type was read (from Monsters.txt) as physical for monsters.<br>[-] My bug: Crash in full screen if BorderlessFullscreen=0.<br>[-] My bug: Mipmaps were always on in full screen if BorderlessFullscreen=0 and MipmapsCount&gt;1.<br>[-] My bug: Empty pictures were causing division by zero in UI Layout code.<br>[-] My bug: Empty sprites causing a crash in D3D mode.<br>[-] UI.txt: 3D view was shifted vertically in the dungeon exit screen.<br>[-] UI.txt: "Press Escape" message wasn't visible after the Win screen.<br>  &lt;&lt; MM7 &gt;&gt;<br>[-] If current fines are due, arcomage win/lose count wasn't added to awards.<br>[-] Master Healer NPC was messing up player skills when activated.<br>[-] Artifacts weren't generated properly as objects on the ground.<br>[-] Artifacts generated in a specific way (as level 7 items) weren't marked as found.

This makes them behave more realistically, especially when looking up at big monsters. Can be disabled by adding SpriteAngleCompensation=0 line to INI.<br>[+] If NoIntro=1 the intro is shown when you click the New Game button in MM6 or start a new game in MM8.

This fix can be disabled by adding SpriteInteractIgnoreId=0 line to INI.<br>[-] GrandMaster of Axe didn't halve armor class. Now the chance to halve armor class is 1.66 per point of skill, so the skill of 60 will make it 100%. This is to compensate for overall weakness of axe wielding.

Can be turned off by adding "SupportTrueColor=0" to INI. You can specify RenderMaxWidth and RenderMaxHeight options to limit maximum rendering resolution if you experience problems with FPS. Hidden options ScalingParam1 (3 by default) and ScalingParam2 (0.2 by default) control crispness of UI scaling.<br>[+] BorderlessFullscreen option makes the game run in your standard resolution, stretched to full screen (with black borders when needed). Set it to 0 to disable.<br>[+] WindowWidth and WindowHeight options control window size in windowed mode.

Number of seconds is controlled by hidden MouseLookRememberTime option.<br>[+] While right mouse button is pressed the mouse look is now deactivated, letting you easily check active spells, current time or perform an action by pressing left mouse button while still holding the right button. Set MouseLookWhileRightClick=1 to keep mouse look active.<br>[+] PlayMP3 option now supports WAV files in Music folder. WAVs always loop properly.<br>[+] Another approach to fixing chests: now chest contents are reordered to make most valuable items be put into the chest first.

Value of 3 is optimal. Bigger values lead to less flickering at distance, but reduce resolution too much. Set to 1 to disable, as it was in original game. Set to -1 to generate a lot of mipmaps.<br>[-] There was a small semi-transparent black contour around sprites and sea shore in Hardware 3D mode.<br>[-] Broken but unidentified items were green instead of red if you go to a shop to repair them.<br>[-] Casting Telepathy spell or stealing from a monster used to prevent you from finding random items in its corpse.<br>[-] Light gray blinking in full screen (not on every system).<br>[-] Arcomage crashing, hanging.<br>[-] Loading game while in movement phase of turn based mode leading to inability to cast spells.<br>[-] Monsters summoned by other monsters had wrong monster as their ally.<br>[-] The game was using "asynchronous" mouse handling incompatible with mouse look of the patch if "D3D Device" = 1 in the registry.

Autonote "2 points of permanent Luck from the well on the western edge of Emerald Island" wasn't used.<br>- Castle Harmondale (d29): Quest "0" no longer appears in Quest Log. Under some circumstances no human/elf/neutral flags were placed in the castle after delivering the artifact. Good/evil flags didn't always match the alignment. Golem was appearing before you complete the quest (and animate it) if you found all parts.<br>- The Wine Cellar (d16): Unique vampire possesing Vampire's Cape item wasn't appearing in the location. Now a Light path quest requires not just entering the Wine Cellar, but killing this vampire as it was planned by developers.<br>- The Pit (d26): "Breeding Zone" entrance animation wasn't used.<br>- Colony Zod (d27): Archibald trial movie was played each time you exit the colony after killing Xenofex. Roland was giving the key each time you click on his cell.<br>- The Dragon Caves (mdt12): A dragon was often spawning inside a wall.<br>- Deyja (out05): guards of the northern town were always hostile.<br>- Texts Kastore was saying upon finding dark/light altar pieces were swapped.<br>- Reward for Loren/Riverside Plans quests even when time runs out.<br>- Final quest wasn't removed from Quest Log upon completion of the game.<br>- Wrong autonote text for Identify Item Grandmaster (Tularean Forest instead of Avlee).<br>- William Lasker was calling the party "Rogues" in his greeting after promotion to Spy, now he says "Spies".<br>- Optional: NWC made a black Mega-Dragon monster with some interesting abilities, but the "Mega-Dragon" in The Dragon Caves (mdt12) was actually a red dragon with resistances set to 0 (thus, weaker than standard ones!). Not anymore.<br>- Optional: Now there are videos when you enter Tunnels to Eeofol or move between Nighon Tunnels and Thunderfist Mountain. These videos were unused before.<br>- Optional: Eastern tunnel of Thunderfist Mountain was leading the the western village and vice versa.<br><br>Other changes:<br>[+] Multiple Quick Saves.

This is controlled by CapsLockToggleRun option since GrayFace Patch. Default is 0 (disabled).<br><br>Changes of official patch 1.1 are listed in Readme.txt<br><br>All options are controlled by mm7.ini.

Set "PlayMP3" to 1. Unlike CD music, MP3 music volume is affected by Sound Volume you set in Settings menu, so it's a good idea to keep it at maximum.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>DataFiles:<br>Create "DataFiles" folder in the game directory. To modify a file in events.lod extract it and place into the "DataFiles" folder. It will be used by the game instead of original file. So, you don't need to insert files into events.lod each time you modify them.<br>"DataFiles" option controls this.

The default mode is like in 3D actions and alternative mode is closer to World of Warcraft and similar games.<br>Here is my preset for 3D action mode: http://sites.google.com/site/sergroj/mm/MM6MouseLook.rar<br><br>You can activate alternative mode by setting MouseLookUseAltMode option to 1 or by pressing Caps Lock if the CapsLockToggleMouseLook option is set to 1.<br>MouseLookChangeKey is used to switch mode (turn off mouse look in normal mode or turn it on in activate mode). The mode is restored if you open any other screen.<br>MouseLookTempKey changes mode while you hold it.
